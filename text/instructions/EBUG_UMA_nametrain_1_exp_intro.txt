You will see creatures from nFamily families.
In this block, there are nSpecies different species in each family, and they are called species theseSpecies. These numbers correspond to the keys listed below.

Eventually you will learn all nSpeciesTotal species, but in this block you will only learn species theseSpecies.

You will identify species theseSpecies from one family,
and you will chunk all species of the other family together as "basicFamStr".

Your job is to press the correct species key for each creature. If you don't know the species number, take your best guess. You must respond quickly.
