You will now see a series of words, each paired with a picture that you saw earlier. The word is presented first, and the picture follows immediately after.

Your job is to learn which word goes with each picture, as you will be asked to remember that word at a later point.
Try to quickly think of a relationship between the word and picture, or make up a story pairing them, so you can remember the connection later.
