This is the final Matching experiment.

The fluid flows you will see are different 
than the ones you saw in the previous tasks, 
but can still be sorted using the same categories.

Using the same categories as the previous tasks,
press "sameKey" if the images of fluid flow are the same type and
press "diffKey" if the images of fluid flow are different types.

Press "contKey" to begin the matching task.
