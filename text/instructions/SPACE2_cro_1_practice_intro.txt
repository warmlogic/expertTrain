Practice

You will now see the images that you learned earlier.

When you see "recallPromptText" you should type the word that was previously paired with the image. Think about the word-image connection you formed earlier and type the word, not a synonym or related word.

Please try to spell accurately; you can use the DELETE key to fix a typo, however you will not be penalized for spelling mistakes.
It is OK to guess if you are fairly confident, but if you cannot remember the word, DELETE any letters you typed and press ENTER.

Press "contKey" to read about the second response.
